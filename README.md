Student Grade Calculator (Java GUI)
Overview
The Student Grade Calculator is a Java-based application designed to calculate and display a student's grade based on the marks obtained in various subjects. The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using JavaFX, which allows users to input marks for each subject, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns the corresponding grade.

This project is ideal for learning basic Java programming concepts, working with GUIs, and performing simple calculations. The application takes the user's marks, computes the required results, and displays them along with the assigned grade.

Features
Input Marks: Users can input the marks obtained in each subject (out of 100).
Total Marks Calculation: Automatically sums up the marks obtained across all subjects.
Average Percentage Calculation: Computes the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.
Grade Calculation: Based on the average percentage, the program assigns a grade:
A: 90% and above
B: 75% to 89%
C: 50% to 74%
D: Below 50%
User-Friendly GUI: An intuitive interface for input and output using JavaFX, making it accessible for users to interact with the system.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
JavaFX: Framework for building the GUI.
VS Code: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
JavaFX SDK: Required for running JavaFX-based applications.
